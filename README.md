# general-weighted-envelope-supplement

This repository contains supplemental materials for the paper 'General model-free weighted envelope estimation.' 

The file Supplement_module_final_EJS.pdf doubles as a somewhat reproducible technical report. All of the code necessary to reproduce most of the calculations in the paper are contained in this pdf file, the source.R file, or in accompanying R scripts in the Rscripts directory. Many of these accompanying R scripts were run on the University of Illinois campus cluster. Output from these jobs is stored in RData files that are contained in the Routput directory. These RData files are loaded in the Supplement_module_final_EJS.pdf document upon compilation of the accompanying Rmd document.

The simulations in Section 5.4 of the paper are not included in the supplementary materials. These simulations are adopted from Matlab code that accompanied [Zhang and Mai [2018]](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/electronic-journal-of-statistics/volume-12/issue-2/Model-free-envelope-dimension-selection/10.1214/18-EJS1449.full). This code is readily available upon request.
